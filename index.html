            <h2>Ocean Acidification</h2>
            <p> Carbon dioxide, which is naturally in the atmosphere, dissolves into seawater. Water and carbon dioxide combine to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), a weak acid that breaks (or “dissociates”) into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).</p>

<p>Because of human-driven increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, there is more CO2 dissolving into the ocean. The ocean’s average pH is now around 8.1offsite link, which is basic (or alkaline), but as the ocean continues to absorb more CO2, the pH decreases and the ocean becomes more acidic.</p>

            <h3> What is Greenhouse Effet?</h3>
            <p>  The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to Earth's surface by “greenhouse gases.” These heat-trapping gases can be thought of as a blanket wrapped around Earth, keeping the planet toastier than it would be without them.</p>  <img src= "https://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/84_Q8-planets.jpg">

            <h2>Global Tempreture In 2021</h2>
            <p>According to the 2021 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2021 was warmer than average, despite the cooling influence from the La Niña climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The "coolest" month was February, which was 1.15 ˚F warmer than average; the rest of the year temperatures were more than 1.4 ˚F warmer than average.</p>
